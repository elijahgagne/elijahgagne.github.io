      <description>Welcome to the first post of my new blog. I have tried to blog a few times in the past, but have always fizzled out. It seems that an important question to ask is, &amp;ldquo;why blog?&amp;rdquo; A few reasons that come to mind off the cuff for me are:
 document things I learn to cement the concepts give myself a place to search and reference my notes share knowledge with others start a dialog with others to learn new things  That all seems nice, but how am I going to keep this going?</description>
